# Skeleton
Java library that wraps up HTML helpers to create web pages based on the Skeleton CSS boilerplate.

The B4J library can actually be used to generate generic HTML code as it has a helper class which is used to generate the Skeleton specific markup. The Skelton CSS can also be replaced by other CSS.
